         Time Man is a mobile application that helps us address the design question, <q>How can we help
         college students efficiently organize their time as well as improve their time management
         skills?</q> by enabling college students to organize assignments, events, and study groups using
         integration with Canvas, Google calendars, and other work tools.

            It is a serious problem that the majority of college students have poor time management
            skills. From freshmen who have not experienced the free college life to seniors who are
            overwhelmed by the impending pressure from the real world, college students often
            experience stress and anxiety caused by poor time management skills.
         </p>
         <p>
            College life is beautiful, but it is not easy for students to <strong>keep track of the
            increased workload, social commitments</strong>, and for <strong>many work hours.</strong>
            Managing their works can be particularly difficult. Their busy and chaotic schedules
            cause a lot of stress. Students are required to use many different tools, such as
            calendars, to-do lists, Canvas, and etc to manage their time effectively. However, there
            is a lot of <strong>unnecessary work in manually copying</strong> and updating data
            between all of these tools and it’s possible to make mistakes, leading to
            disorganization and even missed assignments.

            Therefore, our goal with this project is to make this process easier and less stressful
            for college students to manage their time and provide a less intrusive way to
            incentivize them keep on track of their tasks/assignments.

         <p>
            We wanted to hear from college students to understand their existing workflows. In
            particular, we were curious to hear from students who had previously used a time
            management tool to find out what successes to build on and what pitfalls we could avoid.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 1: Survey</h2>
         <img class="center" src="survey.png" alt="survey" />
         <p>
            We started out with a survey which we posted on various UW internet spaces and shared
            with our classmates.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our main goals were to understand the participants’ workflows, so that we could <strong>
            augment their current efforts</strong>  and reduce or eliminate the tasks that are
            difficult for the users as opposed to what most time management apps do: <strong>force
            the user to manage their time the way the developers believe they should rather than the
            way that people actually do.</strong> This mistake causes many people to stop using
            apps and we wanted to avoid that problem.
         </p>
         <p>
            After analyzing the survey data, we had a basic understanding of our users:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>the majority of students do not plan more than 1–2 days in advance</li>
            <li>being “too pushy” is one reason why students stop using the time management apps</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            We were also very interested in users’ previous pros and cons experience on using
            specific time management tools, however, we didn’t get a lot of specific data through a
            survey. Therefore, we opted to do interview studies to get more details about how
            students use tools in their workflow.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 2: Semi-structured Interviews</h2>
         <p>
            The interview study was conducted with 4 undergraduate UW college students. We asked
            them to talk about how they plan their schedule and then adapted questions to find out
            more about their workflow and their past experiences with time management tools. From
            this, we were able to understand two key ideas.
         </p>
         <p>
            First, students generally use a combination of Canvas plus a calendar and/or a to-do
            list to effectively manage their time. Second, many students use study groups as a way
            to increase their productivity and collaborate on assignments. <strong>These insights
               heavily guided our design, leading to a tool which integrates these three tasks:</strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Planning and visualizing the schedule with a <strong>smart calendar</strong></li>
            <li>Prioritizing tasks with a <strong>task list</strong></li>
            <li>Forming/finding <strong>study groups</strong></li>
         </ul>
